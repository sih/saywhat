A forklift truck driver who was buried under tonnes of cheese for eight hours amazed rescue workers after emerging unscathed.

The man, named by the BBC as Tomasz Wiszniewski, was trapped after shelves at the food distribution warehouse collapsed on Friday morning.

Specialist urban search and rescue teams from the West Midlands, Merseyside and Leicestershire, including sniffer dogs, were involved in trying to pull the Polish worker from the wreckage inside the depot of haulage firm Edwards Transport in Hinstock, Shropshire.

While an onlooker had to be treated for shock, Wiszniewski emerged unharmed.

A West Midlands ambulance service spokesman said: “Astonishingly, after so long trapped under the contents of the warehouse, the worker was able to walk out of the warehouse.

“He was then assessed by the paramedics from the hazardous area response team and was subsequently taken to Princess Royal hospital [in Telford] as a precaution, but he appears uninjured.”

His colleague Debbie Belcher told the BBC: “The sense of relief is just immense. We could not have hoped for a better outcome.”

This is a really great story.
